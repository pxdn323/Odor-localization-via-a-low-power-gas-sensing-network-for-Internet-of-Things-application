# Odor-localization-via-a-low-power-gas-sensing-network-for-Internet-of-Things-application
This project will aim for developing an IoT system in odor localisation. The essence of this project is to build an Internet of Things system that uses the raw data collected from gas sensors for machine learning and presents the calculated location of the odor source to the end user.
